title: "Laravel Breadcrumbs: Rebooted"
---

Sheng here. Dave James Miller's [Laravel Breadcrumbs](https://github.com/davejamesmiller/laravel-breadcrumbs) was part
of the first Laravel project I built over three years ago, and has been a fundamental tool in my toolbox ever since.
With nearly 4 million downloads and over 100 public dependencies, I know I'm not alone. So, when I heard that Dave had
stepped away to focus on more important things (rumor has it he's working on a new theory on quantum entanglement), I
had to jump in.

## Introducing... Laravel Breadcrumbs!

```
composer remove davejamesmiller/laravel-breadcrumbs
composer require diglactic/laravel-breadcrumbs
```

What's new? Well, not much just yet. We've got a handy
[upgrade guide](https://github.com/diglactic/laravel-breadcrumbs/blob/main/UPGRADE.md#upgrading-to-60-from-5x), a
[new namespace](https://packagist.org/packages/diglactic/laravel-breadcrumbs),
and [some sparkly threads](https://github.com/diglactic/laravel-breadcrumbs/blob/main/logo.svg), but all you know and
love about Laravel Breadcrumbs is here to stay.

With that said, Dave has passed along some fantastic ideas and community pull requests that I'm going to be reviewing
over the coming months (and dare I say I have some ideas of my own to throw into the mix). Stay tuned! In the meantime,
feel free to [submit a pull request](https://github.com/diglactic/laravel-breadcrumbs/pulls) if you've got something
you'd like to add right now.

For myself, giving back to the Laravel community has been long overdue, and I'm absolutely stoked I get to begin with a
project like this. Dave, take a bow: it's an honor continuing your work and many thanks for all you've done.
