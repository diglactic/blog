Our commitment to you remains strong during these unprecedented times. We are fortunate to run an online-only business,
and will continue doing so. However, many of you are not in a similar position, and we'd like to help.

If you're struggling to make payments on time, we'll extend any due dates upon request. And if you or someone you know
running a brick-and-mortar business needs assistance pivoting to online sales, we're offering basic complimentary
e-commerce store setups. For more information, please email [covid19@diglactic.com](mailto:covid19@diglactic.com).

Thank you for your continued support. My best wishes to you and yours in the days to come.

Sincerely,

Sheng Slogar
