Our commitment to you remains strong during these unprecedented times. We are fortunate to run a primarily
internet-driven business, and will continue doing so for the foreseeable future. However, many of you are not in the
same position, and we’d like to help.

If you’re struggling to make payments on time, we’ll extend any due dates upon request. And if you or someone you know
running a brick-and-mortar business needs assistance pivoting to online sales, we’re offering complimentary basic
e-commerce store setups over the next few months. For more information, please email us
at [covid19@diglactic.com](mailto:covid19@diglactic.com).

Thank you for your continued support. My best wishes to you and yours in the days to come.

Sincerely,
